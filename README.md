# Minesweeper

Left Click -> reveal a tile

Right Click x1 -> flag a tile

Right Click on flagged tile -> unflags it

First left click -> automatically solves all tiles in a radius from the clicked tile

For a more interesting game, set radius in "ApplyFirstClickHandicap" equal to 2.

Extension ideas:
1. Clear all adjacent zeroes for player convenience 
3. Implement difficulty settings
4. Actual tile graphics using sprites and textures

Remove ImGUI from the project to run
